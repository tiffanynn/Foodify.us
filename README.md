Contributed by Tiffany Nguyen, Christine Nguyen, Jia Cherng Ng, Mohammad Sleiman

## Description
Foodify.us is an application that generates recipes recommendations based on users’ diet preferences, restrictions, calorie limit and etc.  Aside from being a recipe generator, Foodify.us also provides a platform for fellow foodies out there to share their recipes, and allow users to follow accounts that they are interested in. These interactions with the app would provide a more tailored experience for users, as it helps to improve the algorithm on what you would like best.
